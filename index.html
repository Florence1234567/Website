      Il est très probable que beaucoup d’entre nous sommes coupable de surconsommation lorsqu’il s’agit d’un
      produit qui nous apporte du réconfort. Que ce soit de la nourriture, des livres ou bien même des vêtements, il
      y en a pour tous. Pour une grande partie de nous, nos dépendances peuvent sembler banales et inoffensives.
      Cependant, pour certains, l’élément qui apporte du réconfort est malheureusement plus mauvais que bénéfique.
      Les dépendances se trouvent donc à être le point central de ce projet et pour être plus précis ce sont le
      sujet du cannabis et des appareils électroniques. En effet l’accroissement de l’utilisation
      abusive de ses produits n’est pas un évènement récent. Ce phénomène, qui affecte en grande majorité les
      jeunes, est bien plus sérieux qu’on pourrait le croire. Un facteur récurant dans la cause de ses dépendances
      est le stress et l’anxiété. Les jeunes se referment sur eux-mêmes, ainsi, la consommation de
      cannabis et d’appareils électroniques est un moyen de se détendre et de lâcher prise « In contrast, compulsive
      disorders are characterized by anxiety and stress before committing a compulsive repetitive behavior and
      relief from the stress by performing the compulsive behavior.» Il s’agit d’une distraction du monde réel
      et de nos sources d’angoisse et de stresse. Avec l’augmentation d’utilisation de ses produits, il est
      important d’être informé des risques et facteurs que la consommation entraine. Par conséquent, le but de ce
      projet est de comprendre les motifs qui pousse les jeunes à consommer de façon excessive ces mécanismes de
      soulagement pour ensuite sensibiliser les générations futures.

      Many of us are guilty of overconsumption when it comes to feel-good products. Whether it’s food, books or even
      clothing, everyone has a sweet spot. They may seem harmless to a lot of people but in the end, they do
      more harm than good to the body. Addictions will be the backbone subject of this project, and more
      precisely the addiction to cannabis and electronic devices. In fact, the rising abuse of these
      products is not new. This youth targeted phenomenon is worse than people might think. Stress and anxiety are
      usually the reasons that create these addictions. Young people tend to isolate themselves into their own world
      and use cannabis and their technological devices to relax and let go. « In contrast, compulsive
      disorders are characterized by anxiety and stress before committing a compulsive repetitive behavior and
      relief from the stress by performing the compulsive behavior.» With this rising consumption, knowing the
      risk of these products is important. Therefore, the final goal of this project is to understand what motivates
      the youth to use these coping mechanisms and sensitize them.

    <h4 class="m6 w3-padding-large">Introduction</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      With marijuana being legalized in October 2018 and cannabis use increasing by 22% since then specially for people
      between 18 and 24 years old, according to statistics Canada, it is important to be aware of what we put in our
      body even if we might see it as less harmful because of its legalized status. This following text is going to
      answer some questions you might ask yourself about this drug from covering what is cannabis to what are the
      effects of pot? There is also going to have a testimony about an important topic that is psychosis. A
      questionnaire will also be presenting at the end of this text to test your knowledge about this topic.
      <br>
      <br>
      Before starting, as a reminder, cannabis has been legalized for three main reasons: to keep cannabis out of reach
      of youth, to keep the profit out of the black market and at the same time make profit out of it and by finally
      allowing adults to have access to legal cannabis which comes with the information of THC or CBD (Canada
      statistics).
    </p>

    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">What is cannabis?</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      First, cannabis is in both in the stimulant and depressant category acting on the central nervous system.
      Stimulants are drugs that change your energy levels by increasing it. They include cocaine, methamphetamine, and
      prescriptions for ADHD. Depressants, on the other hand, come slow down your brain functions. Some sources like the
      manual of psychopathology even put it in the hallucinogen psychotropic category because in high dose, it can
      provoke light perception distortion such as hallucination. In the following topics, you are going to explore a bit
      of the scientific side of substance consumption to be aware of how it can affect your brain.
      <br>
      <br>
      Let’s talk biology!
      <br>
      <br>
      1.Central nervous system
      <br>
      The central nervous system, different from the peripheric nervous that controls the transmissions, is composed
      with the encephalon and the spinal cord. Responsible for the integration of information, decision-making and
      motricity, it is in the brain where the drastic changes of activities are found when there is a psychotropic
      substance entering the body. It is in the synapses which is the space between neurons that the neurotransmitters
      are affected, and the signals perturbed.
      <br>
      <br>
      2.Neurotransmitter
      <br>
      Neurotransmitters are chemical substance that carry messages from neuron to neuron or from neuron to muscle, cell,
      or gland . A shift in how the neurotransmitter works by drugs can cause a difference in our thoughts, our mood and
      sensation and sometimes the access to our memory.
      <br>
      <br>
      3.Effect of a depressant like alcohol (comparison with cannabis)
      <br>
      For the purpose of your understanding better the how drugs can affect differently, the brain depending on which
      one is in the equation, the comparison with alcohol is relevant.
      <br>
      One of the most used psychotropics worldwide, alcohol can be found in strong liquor such as vodka, beer, and wine
      with the only difference: the percentage of ethanol, an organic compound made from the fermentation of
      agricultural products . Even though more than half of the population drink alcohol according to Gallup News «More
      than six Americans drink alcohol, » not many know the chemical factors that are in cause for that change in the
      brain to be made. Here are some neurotransmitters in cause of that phenomenon.
      <br>
      <br>
      3.1.Dopamine
      <br>
      To start, like the manual “biologie humaine” 3rd edition explains it, alcohol enhances the production of the
      neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) procuring a sensation of well-being. Dopamine is linked with the brains reward
      system being the reason why you might feel like doing something right when drinking alcohol reinforcing by the
      same time the behaviour. Here, we can make the link why it might in some cases lead to dependence. The same
      happens with nicotine and cannabis.
      <br>
      Also, when there is too much dopamine the receptors can temporarily close themselves explaining why some regular
      users are inclined to consume more of that substance because they do not feel the same high, they used to. It is
      called tolerance meaning that the dose must be higher to feel that same euphoria. That can easily transform into a
      vicious cycle leading to addiction including such as physical and psychological.
      <br>
      According to the National Institute on Drug abuse, «cannabis(marijuana) research report available treatments for
      marijuana use disorders ,» there are gladly therapies available for cannabis use disorders such as cognitive
      behavioural therapy that gives tool to the patient to be more self-aware when making decision related to
      consumption, motivational enhancement therapy that targets more the engagement in the treatment by the patient and
      finally contingency management consisting in rewarding the patient for its good actions towards recovery. As the
      study «Psychiatric syndromes in adolescents with marijuana abuse and dependency in outpatient treatment» reveals,
      marijuana use disorders is (especially with adolescent) also correlated with other disorders.
      <br>
      <br>
      3.2.Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
      <br>
      Secondly, GABA is an inhibitor neurotransmitter meaning that it slows the activity of the nervous system in
      response to stress contributing to the sedative and calming effects of alcohol.
      <br>
      <br>
      4.Effect of a stimulant like cannabis
      <br>
      There are two types of major active ingredients in marijuana named as CBD (cannabidiol) and THC
      (tetrahydrocannabinol). Cannabinoids such as these can also be found in the brain naturally.
      <br>
      THC is considered as the psychoactive cannabinoid in cannabis. What happens is that THC imitates anandamide a
      neurotransmitter affecting appetite that is why there is an increase in food intake when using cannabis. It can
      also affect the mood and the perception of time. To resume a bit of CBCNEWS «This is your brain on pot», is that
      THC takes over the role of that neurotransmitter (anandamide). The role being interfering with the message sent
      between the synapses by decreasing it. As it says: “once the job is done, anandamide breaks down quickly”. When
      smoking, THC stays longer in pre-synaptic neuron and is present in greater amounts increasing the dopamine levels
      in the synapses. As it was said before, it can also affect our internal clock. It is the reason why users might
      perceive things more slowly and intensely because inside their brain it is going faster; again, being an effect of
      THC.
      <br>
      CBD contrary to THC is a non-psychoactive compound because it does not activate de CB1 receptor a cannabinoid
      receptor assuming the function to regulate neuronal transmission and other physiological processes like those
      leading to pain, inflammation, memory, and feeding behaviour kind of resuming what has been said earlier. CBD
      benefits help to treat inflammatory bowel disease, seizures, depression, inflammation, psychosis and mental
      disorders and migraines.
    </p>

    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">A bit of cannabis history and medicinal use</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      According to the University of Sidney, cannabis has first been found to be used for medicinal purposes in central
      Asia to be more precise in Western China. The Emperor Shen Nung (2800 BC) considered by many as the Father of
      Chinese medicine was greatly interested in the study of herbs and listed cannabis in the pharmacopoeia for its
      healing properties. Fun fact about cannabis is that its name in Chinese means numbness or anesthesia and it’s
      rumoured that surgeries were performed under a mixture of wine and herbal extracts which might have contained
      cannabis during the Han dynasty . Later with colonization it has been introduced to Africa, Europe, and later
      Americas around 1545 where it was used as fibre.
      <br>
      Since 2001, in Canada, the usage of medicinal cannabis is authorized under certain circumstances. Like the manual
      “biologie humaine” says: It is open to those suffering from multiple sclerosis, lesions or disease in the spinal
      cord, cancer, soda or severe form of arthritis or epilepsy. Marijuana helps with the relief of severe pains from
      these patients. For example, in the case of cancer, chemotherapy can have several sides effect and one that
      cannabis can help relieve is nausea and vomiting acting as an antiemetic. There is also have been studies
      suggesting that cannabis can alleviate some unwanted symptoms associated with mental health conditions such as
      stress, negative mood, irritability, sleep disturbances, and acute response to fear stimuli associated with PTSD
      (Abrams, 2018; Lim et al., 2017)
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">How it is consumed</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      If you go to the SQDC site, after putting your age date because you must be 21 to have access to the site, you can
      find products varying from the classic dried cannabis to accessories. Let’s dive into the different ways to
      consume cannabis. To start, in the home page the most popular products from left to right are in order: dried
      cannabis, pre-rolled cannabis, hash, edibles, beverages, extracts and accessories. There are about 435 products
      for dried cannabis which is usually used to roll or to put on bongs among other methods, a filtration device. Hash
      can be smoked in many ways that can include for example a pipe and it is at the discretion of the users to choose
      between these options. It is interesting to know what the difference of inhaling and ingesting effects are.
      According to the Canadian centre on substance use and addiction, inhaling which includes smoking or vaping takes
      30 minutes to produce its full effects but are usually felt between the first seconds to minutes. It can last up
      to six hours after use. Ingesting, on the other hand, like eating edibles or drinking cannabis beverages take up
      to four hours to feel its peaked effect but can be felt within the first 30 minutes to 2 hours. Contrary to
      inhaling methods, ingesting effects can last up to 12 hours after use. For both, some residual effects can last up
      to 24 hours. For the extract now, they can be oils, oral spies, resin, capsules among others. Some extract can
      have up to 99% THC as mentioned in the online article intitled “7 Things You Need to Know about Cannabis Extracts”
      written by the Canadian Center on Substance Use and Addiction. That is why it is important to be careful when
      using this product because it can increase the risk of intoxication.
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Marijuana effects</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      It is without doubt that higher use of cannabis provokes greater risks of developing psychotic symptoms in those
      with pre-existing vulnerability such as genetic predisposition. For example, if there is schizophrenia in the
      family there is a greater risk of developing that disorder with the use of marijuana. Population such as those
      that don’t know they have a mood disorder or a psychotic disorder and those who are diagnosed with that mental
      illness is vulnerable to that substance aggravating in certain cases some symptoms.
      «In Canada, the rate of hospitalizations for cannabis-related mental and behavioural disorders doubled between
      2006 and 2015, with psychotic disorder being the most common condition among hospitalizations (Maloney-Hall et
      al., 2020) ».
      <br>
      Indeed, cannabis-induced <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a> or <a href="secondary">secondary psychosis</a> can
      happen after smoking a high dose of cannabis,
      However, toxic induced psychosis “resolve with abstinence, and are of shorter duration than those observed with
      <a href="primary">primary psychotic disorders</a>” (British. To put that into perspective, a scenario that could
      be very plausible is
      someone not knowing they have a vulnerability to cannabis and then smoking having as a result an amplification of
      symptoms that were at that time almost unnoticeable. An interesting fact to keep in mind is that 50% of people
      having experienced a psychotic episode caused by cannabis will develop psychotic disorder such a schizophrenia
      later in life according to large-scale studies made in Denmark and Finland resulting in a <a
        href="substance">substance-induced
        disorder</a>.
      <br>
      Additionally, to having an impact on the development of psychosis, cannabis has also been reported that it can
      affect other disorders such as bipolar disorder. Indeed, it is linked with a longer manic episode increasing the
      severity of the symptoms or to, furthermore, trigger the first manic episode (Gibbs et al., 2015).

    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      Before I had psychosis, I didn’t know what it was. I had no idea what was happening to me. I was clueless with
      doctors telling me: you are schizophrenic and it’s chronic. The problem with psychosis is that it is hard to know
      the exact diagnosis for the patient, especially when it’s their first psychotic episodes. In my case, it was mania
      that turned into a psychosis, resulting in a bipolar disorder diagnosis. Even if it is not uncommon to have mixed
      disorders diagnosis such as anxiety and depression, I did not have comorbidities, just bipolar disorder, which I
      still have. Yet one year later, I am skeptical of that result. At this point you might ask yourself: what is the
      link with cannabis? The fact is that this affective disorder was triggered by marijuana consumption.
      <br>
      I used to take edibles each day because it would just make things taste and feel better. I was happy all the time,
      maybe too much. I was in a constant high, and I was not hungry. I was starting to lose weight and my parents
      noticed. I felt like I could save the world and change it for the best, I could save the people I love, from
      themselves and to make them realize life is full of opportunities. I was living in a fairy tale, and utopia. I was
      motivated to take responsibility for all the wrong made to the universe. I was unstoppable and everything felt
      like it was in the palm of my hand. My motivation was to the roof. I felt like I could see right through everyone.
      I never felt so good in my life.
      <br>
      One night, I smoked too much, and it all started to go downhill. It might have been because I felt pressure to do
      so because for some reason, I could not say no. I did not know my limits and thought I felt comfortable enough to
      try to go further, to go even higher. I suddenly felt extremely anxious every time the people around me would not
      understand me. The emotions I felt were disproportionate to the situations. I kept doing analogies about stuff
      nobody would understand and each time they would give me those confused eyes and interior world would crumble,
      destroyed into pieces. I did not know what was normal or not anymore and what was common knowledge or not. I just
      keep talking without a filter.
      <br>
      I could not sleep for days; I was restless, staring at my ceiling and always preoccupied. I had many delusional
      thoughts; I felt like people were following me that they were constantly talking about me when actually they were
      just having a conversation completely unrelated to me. Even on Netflix I felt like people on it were addressing
      subliminal messages to me by sending me quests to complete and I also thought I was in a simulation, similar to
      “Joan is awful,” which is an episode from the Black mirror. To resume it, the protagonist did not know when she
      signed the contract of Netflix that she agreed for her personal life to get leaked. Everyone knew how much of an
      awful person she was and devastated that she was trying to find a way to get out of this situation. She later
      finds out she is not even real and that she actually lives in a remake of someone else’s life. I indeed felt like
      the worst person ever. I felt like I did not have a superego anymore, nor an id nor had an ego. I simply just did
      not know who I was anymore. Someone could have told me I was the mother of four children I would have believed
      them. I was a mixed of fragmented psyche from each little thing of my past that destroyed me. I was lost into
      everyone’s identity. I could not recognize myself.
      <br>
      I also could not control my thoughts, they were evading me, transforming every little interaction in a torture
      mechanism reminding me that I could not communicate with the exterior world anymore without feeling persecuted. I
      was losing touch with reality. My sanity, escaping. I would hear things no one else could. It was terrifying to be
      consumed by a reality only I had access to. It was suffering and I never felt so lost in my life.
      <br>
      When I had enough, when I was finally devasted by everything, I asked my mother to go to the ER. I was there for
      3-4 days and put under medication. These days felt like forever. During that time, I had no idea what was
      happening to me but if I knew the repercussions of cannabis, I would have been more cautious with my usage. Now I

    <h4 class="m6 w3-padding-large">Introduction</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      The excessive usage of devices is a phenomenon that peaked at the beginning of 2020, more precisely when COVID
      started. Our lives were shaken as we had stopped all our regular activities. As a result, many had to switch to
      online work or school and the only way to contact our friends and family was by video call. Isolation was a tough
      period for everyone as it left some long-term effects on us. Some people used their electronics for an excessive
      amount of time every day and kept this habit. As our lives went back to normal, the consequences of this bad habit
      began to show in people’s lives. A couple of questions were created regarding many aspects and aftermaths of
      screen addiction to conduct a survey. People of all ages answered the survey in hopes of getting a variety of
      opinions. Nonetheless, the scientific answers to all these questions are regarding youth, more specifically people
      from ages 12 to 24.
      <br>
      <br>
      In order to get a broader perspective on the subject, here is a list of questions that were answered using
      scientific articles. Our goal is to inform the youth as much as possible and hopefully get them to take a step
      back, make them think about their habits and maybe realize that some of them are not that healthy.
      <br>
      <br>
      Under each question you will find short audios to summarize the answers. The purpose of these audios is to
      hopefully allow some visually impaired people who are interested in our research to get the information they seek.
      The goal is to make our platform available for everyone, so everybody has a change to learn about this topic.

    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">1. What are the long-term effects of screen addiction on mental and physical
      health?</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      It is without a doubt that the over usage of electronics has their effects on people’s mental and physical health.
      First, children’s mental health is drastically affected by how much time they spend on social media every day.
      Social media platforms are filled with negative comments, mean people with the only purpose of putting others
      down. Witnessing such rude comments has got to have an impact on their mental health. As mentioned in an online
      article entitled “Impact of internet addiction on mental health: potential impact and therapies” written by Ahmed
      Zayed and reviewed by Dr. Harshi Dhingra, the excessive usage of social media for instance result in a “constant
      exposure to negative online experiences, social isolation, [...] and <a href="#dopamine">dopamine</a>-driven
      reward cycles associated with excessive internet use can all contribute to the development and exacerbation of
      these mental health conditions.” Moreover, young children learn from others, which is not good news seeing how
      people treat each other online. Secondly, the excessive usage of electronic devices affects children’s physical
      health. Much research was conducted to determine if screen addiction has something to do with children
      participating in less physical activities. To no one’s surprise, “smartphone addiction was associated with less
      physical activity, such as daily walking, and consequently may be harmful to physical health by resulting in
      higher fat mass and decreasing muscle mass induced by less physical activity” as mentioned in, “Relationship
      between smartphone addiction and physical activity in Chinese international students in Korea” written by Sung-Eun
      Kim Jin-Woo Kim and Yong-Seok Jee.

    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;" class="w3-padding-large">My personal experience :</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      Growing up, I spent my evenings playing outside with my friends as soon as we came back from school up until the
      sun went down. It saddens me to go outside these days and see the streets empty, even on beautiful days that are
      perfect for spending time outside. To me, the way children grow up is completely different than how it used to be
      when I was a kid. Nowadays the streets are quiet, and the kids are nowhere to be found. Children are now locked
      inside, playing on their devices from morning to night. It is concerning to look at the current situation because
      playing outside, doing some physical activity and interacting with friends are important to a child’s development.
      Hopefully, parents will eventually put their foot down and add some restrictions to their children screen access.
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">2. What are the consequences of device usage in class?
    </h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      To begin, the use of devices such as laptops and iPads in class in very common these days, mostly in Cégep and
      universities. Some secondary schools allow students to take notes on their devices but most of them are reluctant.
      Some of them believe that students aren’t mature enough to have access to an electronic device during class, that
      they will use them to play games or even chat with their friends. As we saw recently in the news, the minister of
      education, Bernard Drainville, ordered schools to prevent students from bringing their phones in class. Drainville
      says it will create a better environment and promote success for students. Was this decision a good idea? Here are
      some pros and cons of having a cellphone in class.
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;" class="w3-padding-large">Pros :</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      1. In case of an emergency, a cellphone can be useful. For example, if the children are trapped in a room, having
      a phone can allow them to call emergency services or get in contact with their parents to make them aware of the
      situation.
      <br>
      2. An electronic device can allow us to research something online. Some people have a hard time understanding when
      a teacher explains a concept, for example. A quick search can help a student understand like the website <a
        href="https://www.alloprof.qc.ca/">AlloProf</a>
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;" class="w3-padding-large">Cons :</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      1. Cellphones can be a huge distraction in class. Many students use their phones in class to either text their
      friends or even listen to music. Those students will have missed parts of the lesson which can lead to
      difficulties in doing homework and evaluations.
      <br>
      2. Having an electronic device nearby makes it easier for students to cheat in tests. If students are allowed to
      use their devices, the teachers need to be careful in supervising the students. As a student in computer science,
      we have no choice but to do our tests on our computers. That is why our teachers usually roam through the
      classroom and look at our screens to make sure no one is cheating.
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;" class="w3-padding-large">My personal experience :</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      When I entered secondary school, I chose the multimedia program. They made the program look really interesting,
      having access to computers to take notes in class, iPads to create projects in art class that couldn’t be done
      with a simple pencil and a sheet of paper. Unfortunately, the program was not exactly what we were promised. We
      still had access to iPads in art class, but we weren’t able to take notes on our computer in our regular classes.
      The reason for that is because the students from the year before us didn’t follow the rules. They used the
      computers for non-academic related activities. I was disappointed that the program wasn’t what I was expecting,
      yet
      I understood their decision. As I say how my classmates and I sneaked our phones into class, I understood that
      maybe we weren’t mature enough to have computers in class. Or maybe we were well supervised. Nonetheless, I am
      torn, and it is hard for me to formulate an answer to this question.
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">3. What consequences did COVID have on screen usage?</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      As our lives abruptly stopped in March of 2020, we were locked into our homes, unable to see our family and
      friends. Children had to find a way to entertain themselves. Many of them spent the day on electronics such as a
      tablet, a video game console or a computer. The lack of social interactions had massive consequences on the
      children.
      <br>
      <br>
      The effect of excessive screen usage during the pandemic had different consequences depending on the age of the
      children. Children younger than six-year-old developed conduct problems when watching television or using a
      tablet. On the other hand, children around the age of 11 were more likely to develop depression, anxiety and
      stress from either online school or even personal usage such as television and video games, for example.
      However, these statistics are a generalization. Many introverted people, like me, found online school and even the
      lockdown much easier than the lifestyle we had before. That is why these statistics might not apply to them.
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;" class="w3-padding-large">My personal experience :</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      As an introverted person, I would be lying if I said I did not like online classes. I liked staying in the comfort
      of my room and to do my homework peacefully after the class is done. I have never liked being surrounded by others
      like you are when you go to school. However, I know my situation is not the case for everybody. My parents, for
      instance, did not like the lockdown very much. They often went for walks for go for a quick drive to nowhere just
      to change from being in the house all day. Even though I liked the lockdown, I obviously had more free time. I
      spent more time than before playing video games or watching the television. Nonetheless, my schedule went back to
      normal once the schools opened and we had to go back. I had less free time, so I had to cut back on my screen
      time. I know some people found it harder to let go of their devices for the day, especially children who got used
      to the same routine every day.
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">4. What are the effects of excessive electronic usage on people’s sleep schedule?
    </h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      Growing up, my mom always told me that being on my iPad before going to bed was going to keep me awake, yet I
      didn’t believe her. As I got older and went on my phone late at night, I realized that what she was saying all
      these years was actually true. Using electronic devices late at night is more harmful than people may believe. In
      fact, not getting enough sleep can make a person irritable and reduce their concentration.
      <br>
      The main cause of sleep disruption caused by electronic devices is the lack of melatonin. Indeed, “Studies show
      two or more hours of screen time in the evening can seriously disrupt the melatonin surge needed to fall sleep,”
      as mentioned in the article entitled, “Screens and Your Sleep: The Impact of Nighttime Use” written by Joanna A.
      Cooper. It is recommended to close all devices an hour before going to bed and occupy ourselves with other
      activities such as reading, for example. It is actually the blue light emitted by any electronic devices that
      prevent the production of melatonin. An article entitled “How blue light affects your eyes, sleep, and health”
      written by Cultivating Health mentioned the consequences of blue lights on the sleep pattern : “Exposure to blue
      light before bedtime also can disrupt sleep patterns as it affects when our bodies create <a
        href="#melatonin">melatonin</a>. Interruption
      of the <a href="#circadian">circadian system</a> plays a role in the development of type 2 diabetes,
      cardiovascular disease, cancer, sleep
      disorders, and <a href="#cognitive">cognitive dysfunctions</a>.”
      <br>
      These articles make us realize the importance of
      putting away our devices
      in the evening in order to give time to our brain to produce the melatonin we need for a good night’s sleep.
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;" class="w3-padding-large">My personal experience :</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      I am not ashamed to say that I use my cell phone a bit too much. In the last few weeks, my sleep schedule is the
      worst it’s ever been. I sleep at most five hours at night because I stay on my phone too late. Not only do I ruin
      on little to not sleep during the day, but I have missed my alarm more in the last couple of weeks than ever
      before. I have also noticed that I am more irritable. The end of the semester is hard, and I am trying my best to
      improve my bad habit.
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">5. Should parents give their young children smartphones as it affects their mental
      health?</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      At the present time, children are given cellphones by their parents at a really young age. It can be useful to always stay in touch with their kids at all times, or even to be able to reach emergency services in case something happens. However, kids become addicted to their tiny devices and are not able to let go of it. It is more common these days for children to possess phones as opposed to people born in the 2000s or before. An article entitled “Kids Who Get Smartphones Earlier Become Adults with Worse Mental Health” written by Jon Haidt and Zach Rausch showed the correlation between the age of getting a cellphone and the Average Mental Health Quotient (MHQ).
    </p>
    <img src="./Graph.png" alt="image" width="400" class="w3-image">
    <br>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      The age of phone ownership clearly demonstrates that it affects kids’ mental health drastically. These statistics do not refer only to screen usage, but also less physical activity and less time spent outside for example.
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;" class="w3-padding-large">My personal experience :</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      As I watch the younger generation grow up, I realized that I was part of the last generation to grow up without a
      device at a young age. It is rare nowadays that I witness children playing outside like we used to do back when I
      was young. Children now spend a hot summer day playing video games inside. I believe that this is alarming because
      children will have a harder time forming friendships with other children.
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">6. What are the outcomes of screen usage on peoples’ social skills?</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      The use of devices has proven to decrease children’s social skills as mentioned in an article entitled “The
      Effects of Screen Time on Children” written by Jeremy Bidwell: “Screen time can also reduce person to person
      interactions and limit social skills. It is becoming more and more rare to see children using their imaginations
      or playing outside. Instead, it is becoming much more common to see a group of children engrossed in their
      tablets. This loss of social skills is perhaps the negative issue that bothers people the most.”
      <br>
      <br>
      As studies have proven, adolescents diagnosed with <a href="#adhd">ADHD</a> are more likely to develop an internet
      addiction. With ADHD being the most common cognitive disorder, these statistics are alarming. Children affected by
      ADHD
      find it more difficult to understand social cues and understand emotions.
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">7. What are the effects of social media addiction regarding body image?</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      It is to no surprise that social media <a href="#influencer">influencers</a> make many of their followers insecure
      about their body. As the
      usage of social media increased in the last few years, more teenagers are targeted by this type of content. From
      content creators like Kylie Jenner or even Megan Fox, the picture they post on their Instagram account tend to
      make young girls insecure about their bodies. Yet these women and many more Instagram models have had some work
      done to improve their look. The online article entitled “Selfie-Esteem: The Relationship Between Body
      Dissatisfaction and Social Media in Adolescent and Young Women” written by Bindal Makwana, Yaeeun Lee, Susannah
      Parkin and Leland Farmer puts the spotlight on the effects of social media on children’s body image : “Lewallen
      and Behm-Morawitz (2016) suggest that adolescent girls and young women following fitness boards on Pinterest were
      more likely to report intentions to engage in extreme weight-loss behaviours, such as <a href="#crash">crash
        dieting</a> or a radical
      exercise plan.” These weight-loss methods are incredibly dangerous and could do some serious damage on children.
      Regarding social media posts, it is well known that apps such as <a href="#facetune">FaceTune</a> are used by
      these influencers in order
      to make themselves look better. However, young women are still comparing themselves with these models as they are
      the ones setting the beauty standard.
      It is to no surprise that social media <a href="#influencer">influencers</a> make many of their followers insecure
      about their body.
      As the usage of social media increased in the last years, more teenagers are targeted by this type of content.
      “Lewallen and Behm-Morawitz (2016) suggest that adolescent girls and young women following fitness boards on
      Pinterest were more likely to report intentions to engage in extreme weight-loss behaviors, such as <a
        href="#crash">crash dieting</a> or a
      radical exercise plan.”
      <br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, <a href="#cyber">cyberbullying</a> can occur and destroy people's self-esteem. Social media a
      filled with mean people that keep on tearing other people down. To prevent those kinds of comments on your
      account, it is best to keep your account private as only your friends and the people who you accepted their
      request can see what you post.
      <br>
      <br>
      The effects mentioned above can unfortunately result in an <a href="#eating">eating disorder</a>. People who want
      to lose weight fast turn to this method as it is really efficient. Unfortunately, it causes massive damage on
      people, especially children as their body are still developing.
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">8. What are the financial consequences of screen addiction?</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      As most of us are aware, it is now possible to buy lottery tickets as well as scratch cards online. From an
      environmental point of view, we are making great progress as there is no waste in buying online lottery tickets,
      unlike physical tickets that are printed on paper and also come with a receipt from the register. While the
      progress we made is a game changer for the gambling world, you can now buy them from the comfort of your home,
      which is maybe not a good idea. Having the power to buy a lottery ticket in under 30 seconds might convince people
      to buy it impulsively as opposed to having to go in stores to get it. Some of them might change their minds or get
      discouraged if they had to go get it at the store. The accessibility is an important factor to take into
      consideration. Nevertheless, the Loto-Québec app has a feature that allows you to set a limit on how much money
      you want to spend every day. This feature is a step in the right direction, though were a not quite there yet. The
      only problem is that you have to set yourself these limits and know when it is best for you to stop.
    </p>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Subject conclusion</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      To summarize, all the subjects listed above hopefully will educate the youth a little bit more on the consequences of excessive device usage. The goal here is to inform people for them to take a step back a maybe realize that they practise these habits. There are solutions to reduce screen time and practise healthier activities, this will improve drastically their mental and physical health.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">Conclusion</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      In conclusion, we hope that our readers learned a thing our two from this special addiction article. The goal was to educate the youth, use articles written by professionals in their fields in order to deliver the real statistics. We also wanted to include our own personal experiences, to hopefully make our research a bit more relatable towards young people. We hope that this has helped, at least a little bit, the youth to understand the danger of these addictions. Although this is not nearly enough to solve the problem, this is a step in the right direction. We look forward to see what improvements are coming in the future, to see the world become a better environment for everybody.
