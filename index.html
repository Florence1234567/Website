      Il est très probable que beaucoup d’entre nous sommes coupable de surconsommation lorsqu’il s’agit d’un
      produit qui nous apporte du réconfort. Que ce soit de la nourriture, des livres ou bien même des vêtements, il
      y en a pour tous. Pour une grande partie de nous, nos dépendances peuvent sembler banales et inoffensives.
      Cependant, pour certains, l’élément qui apporte du réconfort est malheureusement plus mauvais que bénéfique.
      Les dépendances se trouvent donc à être le point central de ce projet et pour être plus précis ce sont le
      sujet des vapoteuses, du cannabis et des appareils électroniques. En effet l’accroissement de l’utilisation
      abusive de ses produits n’est pas un évènement récent. Ce phénomène, qui affecte en grande majorité les
      jeunes, est bien plus sérieux qu’on pourrait le croire. Un facteur récurant dans la cause de ses dépendances
      est le stress et l’anxiété. Les jeunes se referment sur eux-mêmes, ainsi, la consommation de vapoteuses, de
      cannabis et d’appareils électroniques est un moyen de se détendre et de lâcher prise« In contrast, compulsive
      disorders are characterized by anxiety and stress before committing a compulsive repetitive behavior and
      relief from the stress by performing the compulsive behavior.» (1). Il s’agit d’une distraction du monde réel
      et de nos sources d’angoisse et de stresse. Avec l’augmentation d’utilisation de ses produits, il est
      important d’être informé des risques et facteurs que la consommation entraine. Par conséquent, le but de ce
      projet est de comprendre les motifs qui pousse les jeunes à consommer de façon excessive ces mécanismes de
      soulagement pour ensuite sensibiliser les générations futures.

      Many of us are guilty of overconsumption when it comes to feel-good products. Whether it’s food, books or even
      clothing, everyone has a sweet spot. They even may seem harmless to a lot of people but in the end, they are
      more harmful than good for the body. Addictions will be the backbone subject of this project, and more
      precisely the obsession over vaping, cannabis, and electronic devices. In fact, the rising abuse of these
      products is not new. This youth targeted phenomenon is worse than usually imagined. Stress and anxiety are
      usually the reasons that create these addictions. Young people tend to isolate themselves into their own world
      and use vaping, cannabis, and their technological devices to relax and let go. « In contrast, compulsive
      disorders are characterized by anxiety and stress before committing a compulsive repetitive behavior and
      relief from the stress by performing the compulsive behavior.» (1)With this rising consumption, knowing the
      risk of these products is important. Therefore, the final goal of this project is to understand what motivates
      the youth to use these coping mechanisms and sensitize them.

    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      It is without doubt, that higher use of cannabis provokes greater risks of developing psychotics symptoms in those
      with pre-existing predisposition such as genetic predisposition per example if there is schizophrenia in the
      family, the sex of the user and age factors (smoking before the adult age) among others. Population such as those
      that don’t know they have a mood disorder or a psychotic disorder and those who are diagnose with those mental
      illness are vulnerable.

      «In Canada, the rate of hospitalizations for cannabis-related mental and behavioral disorders doubled between 2006
      and 2015, with psychotic disorder being the most common condition among hospitalizations (Maloney-Hall et al.,
      2020) ».

      Indeed, cannabis-induced psychosis can happen after smoking a high dose of cannabis, However, toxic induced
      psychosis “resolve with abstinence, and are of shorter duration than those observed with primary psychotic
      disorders”(Biritsih. An interesting fact to keep in mind is that 50% of people having experienced a psychotic
      episode caused by cannabis will develop psychotic disorder such a schizophrenia later in life according to large
      scale studies made in Denmark and Finland.

    <h4 class="m6 w3-padding-large">Introduction</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      The excessive usage of devices is a phenomenon that peaked at the beginning of 2020, more precisely when COVID
      started. Our lives were shaken as we had stopped all our regular activities. As a result, many had to switch to
      online work or school and the only way to contact our friends and family was by video call. Isolation was a tough
      period for everyone as it left some long-term effects on us. Some people used their electronics for an excessive
      amount of time everyday and kept this habit. As our lives went back to normal, the consequences of this bad habit
      began
      to show in people’s lives. A couple of questions were created regarding many aspects and aftermaths of screen
      addiction to conduct a survey. People of all ages answered the survey in hopes of getting a variety of opinions.
      Nonetheless, the scientific answers to all these questions are regarding youth, more specifically people from ages
      12 to 24.

    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">1. What are the long-term effects of screen addiction on mental and physical
      health?</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      As mentionned in a online article entitled “Impact of internet addiction on mental health: potential impact and
      therapies” written by Ahmed
      Zayed and reviewed by Dr. Harshi Dhingra, the excessive usage of social media for instance result in a “constant
      exposure to negative
      online experiences, social isolation, [...] and <a href="#dopamine">dopamine</a>-driven reward cycles associated
      with
      excessive internet use can all contribute to the development and exacerbation of these mental health conditions.”

    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">5. What are the effects of excessive electronic usage on people’s sleep schedule?
    </h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">

    <h4 style="letter-spacing: 0px;">6. Should parents be held responsible for giving their young children smartphones
      as it affects their mental
      health?</h4>
    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      An article entitled “Kids Who Get Smartphones Earlier Become Adults With Worse Mental Health” written by Jon Haidt
      and Zach Rausch showed the correlation between the age of getting a cellphone and the Average Mental Health

    <p class="w3-large m6 w3-padding-large">
      The use of devices has proven to decrease children’s social skills as mentioned in an article entitled “The
      Effects
      of Screen Time on Children” written by Jeremy Bidwell: “Screen time can also reduce person to person interactions
      and limit social skills. It is becoming more and more rare to see children using their imaginations or playing
      outside. Instead, it is becoming much more common to see a group of children engrossed in their tablets. This loss
      of social skills is perhaps the negative issue that bothers people the most.”
      <br>
      <br>
      As studies have proven, adolescents diagnosed with <a href="#adhd">ADHD</a> are more likely to develop an internet addiction. With
      ADHD being the most common cognitive disorder, these statistics are alarming.
